<p>Wilted lettuce salad offers a unique blend of comfort and nutrition, combining the high water content and vitamins of raw lettuce with a slightly cooked, tender texture that is often easier to digest. The warm dressing (commonly bacon grease and vinegar) breaks down the cell walls, making nutrients more accessible while providing a savory, sweet, and tangy flavor profile</p>
